\section{Algorithm Description - Double Ratchet Algorithm}
The double ratchet algorithm is creating a very secure way for two people to exchange messages through the use of a shared secret key. With many encryption algorithms once the key is discovered the encryption is compromised because a third party can decrypt all the messages being sent. The double ratchet algorithm solves this problem by consistently generating new keys. Every message generates a new one of these keys which can be used to decrypt the message meaning that having any single key will only give access to a singular message and cannot be used to retrieve any other keys making this extremely secure.
